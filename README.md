# Hey, I'm Steven Wang👋
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=gszfwsb.gszfwsb)  
🍻 I'm currently a last-year undergraduate student in School of Software, [HIT](http://en.hit.edu.cn/).   
💻 I'll pursue my MPhil degree in [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) from 2022, advised by [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/).  
📘 Previously, I once did research at [IIIS, THU](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) and [JHC, SJTU](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/).  Thanks to all the collaborators and instructors.  
👉 My research interests range across Interpretability in machine learning(deep learning), Multi-modal Learning and Computer Vision.  
✨ I love playing chess, piano, guitar, singing, reading and watching movies. I was a semi-professional chess player in my teenage years.  
🚀 I’m always open for academic collaboration and you can find more about me via my personal website [Steven Wang's Homepage](https://gszfwsb.github.io/).
